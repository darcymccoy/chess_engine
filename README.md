# My Chess Engine
A chess engine capable of playing chess against a human or against itself. The engine uses a minimax algorithm to find the top move.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Java

This is a personal project that I started completely for fun. However, the scale of this project continues to grow and in the future I plan to submit this engine to chess engine tournaments. This project has been and continues to be completely written by me.

## How to Run:
1. This requires git and a Java IDE
2. Clone the repo
```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
```
3. Run the file: src/chessengine/driver/Driver.java
